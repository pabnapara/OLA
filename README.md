Project Title:
OLA Ride Data Analysis and Dashboard Development

Project Description:
This project involves analyzing OLA ride booking data using SQL and creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key business metrics. The aim is to understand booking trends, cancellations, payment methods, ride distances, and customer/driver performance, which can assist OLA in improving its services.

Objectives:
Data Analysis with SQL:

Extract and analyze ride booking data using SQL queries.

Create views for key performance metrics such as successful bookings, average ride distances, and cancellation statistics.

Identify customer and driver patterns based on ratings, vehicle types, and booking values.

Dashboard Development in Power BI:

Build an interactive dashboard (OLA_Dash_Board.pbix) to visualize ride performance metrics.

Provide insights on booking trends, cancellations, ratings, and revenue generation.

Key Features (SQL Analysis):
The SQL queries perform the following tasks:

Retrieve all successful bookings.

Find the average ride distance per vehicle type.

Calculate the number of rides canceled by customers.

List the top 5 customers with the most bookings.

Identify rides canceled by drivers due to personal or car-related issues.

Determine max and min driver ratings for Prime Sedan rides.

Retrieve rides where payments were made via UPI.

Calculate the average customer rating per vehicle type.

Compute the total booking value of successful rides.

List incomplete rides with reasons.

Key Features (Power BI Dashboard):
Visual Reports on successful vs. canceled bookings.

Top Customers & Revenue Insights.

Ratings Analysis for both drivers and customers.

Ride Distance and Vehicle Type Analysis.

Payment Method Distribution.

Tools & Technologies Used:
SQL (for data querying and view creation).

Power BI (for dashboard design and visualization).

Database: OLA Booking Database.

Outcome:
The project delivers a clear and interactive analytical solution for OLA bookings data. The dashboard allows stakeholders to monitor key KPIs such as booking trends, cancellations, customer satisfaction, and revenue, thereby helping in data-driven decision-making.
